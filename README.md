**Document Summarization using Encoder Decoder Architecture LSTM**
<br/>

*Overview:* <br/>

We will do initial data pre-processing using nlp techniques such as stemming / lemmatization then our tokenized input will be transformed to vector embeddings using GloVe embedding. Finally our processed data will be fed to the encoder decoder lstm model created from scratch, The output will be a coherent ,concise summary of our input document.
